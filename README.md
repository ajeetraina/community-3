# Docker Community Repository

Welcome to the Docker Community repo! This repo aims to centralize content (HOW-TOs, scripts, slides, events etc) curated by Docker Captains, Docker Community Leaders. The main objective is to help members of the Docker community who share similar interests to learn from & collaborate with each other during events. 

This is a community oriented and run repository, which is maintained by Docker community members. This is the perfect place to host projects, proofs of concept, documentation, and more...

Please help by joining the Slack channel (we like to talk about Docker in general, even if you only have questions — discussion helps the community and guides improvements) and contributing to the guide. This guide is open to contributions, so unlike a blog, it can keep improving. Like any open source effort, we combine efforts but also review to ensure high quality.
