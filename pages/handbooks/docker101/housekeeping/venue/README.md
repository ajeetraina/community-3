# What to Consider When Searching for a Venue

Choosing a venue for a workshop is the one decision that will have the largest impact on your event. The date of the event, catering options, and attendees’ pleasant experiences … all are partly affected by which venue you select.

For a successful workshop, here are few important considerations, community leaders should consider when searching for a venue:



##  Book a venue 

Book a venue at least 4-6 months in advance so that you will have enough time to plan other critical things, such as catering, event brochures, and websites.


## Find a location

Look out for a venue within a reasonable distance from most attendees’ homes or places of work. Ensure that there is a proper WiFi connectivity in the premises.

## Parking

You can reserve nearby parking lots for your attendees and either include the cost in the ticket prices, or have attendees pay when they park.

## Capacity and Minimums

You’ll need to know the room capacity of the venues for a few reasons.

## Cost(optional)

Being flexible on the event date can be a great way to negotiate with venues. They may have open dates on their calendar that they want to fill. By providing 2-3 date options, you are more likely to get discounted pricing.


# Tips to search for a venue

Finding the right venue for your event can take up quite a bit of your time. Thankfully there are a few shortcuts to help you save time:

- Ask the community members if their organization would be interested to host the workshop for FREE.
- Contact the area’s local Convention & Visitor’s Bureau to inquire about venues that best suit your needs.
- On event listing websites, such as 10 times, eventful, etc., find similar local events to yours and see where they host events.
- Use an online tool, such as Unique Venues, EventUp, weworks etc. They help you parse through the many venues to find the one right for you.
